// 1. Candidate must fetch API to get the movies data
// 2. Search by name should work on its own on press Enter
// 3. Search by genre should work on its own (any movie which contains one of the genre)
// 4. Genre can be added or removed
// 5. Sort by rating should work on its own
// 6. All filters should work when use in conjuction with one another (AND)
// 7. If no search is active, returned all movies
// 8. By default movie is sorted by highest rating to lowest
// 9. Candidate must style the displayed result and the ratings
// 10. By default, the banner returned the first movie on the list, unless user selected a movie.

// WRITTEN PORTION
// 1. Currently the API can only fetched all movies all at once. What is the drawback of this and how would you improve it?
// How would your implementation affect the search feature, if any?
// 2. Let say we add more filters, such as
// 1. sort by release date
// 2. search by actors / actress (e.g return true if one of the actor in movie matched list of given actors)
// 3. search by keywords in synopsis
// How would you implement this? (the idea here is they should start having filter of type SORT, FILTER, and SEARCH_BY_TEXT instead of create 6 react states for each search)
// 3. If we want to add the ability for users to save movies to a personal watchlist, what frontend changes would you make?
